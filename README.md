# petya_cpu_filedecryption
This program can be used to manually decrypt the master file table entries when Petya is not capable in doing that. It completely works CPU based and assumes that you have two diskdumps of your harddrive as files available. One which contains the dump and a copy of it that the program uses to work on.
